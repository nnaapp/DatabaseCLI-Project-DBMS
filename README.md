# DatabaseCLI-Project-DBMS
Command line based program for preset queries in a local MySQL database, written for a DBMS class.

In IDE terminal, your database password will be shown when logging in. This is due to there not being a 
good way to hide it, that I could find. In a true terminal, your password will be hidden Unix style when
logging into the database.
